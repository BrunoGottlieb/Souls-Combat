A Unity project made for study purpose. 

All assets used on this project are free to use, except the sounds and musics that are from Dark Souls 1 game.

I can't say if the game works fine with a Playstation controller, I only tested with a Xbox one. Keyboard and mouse works fine.

There are optimization options in the menu, if you don't have a video card.

This game is ultra-wide screen compatible.
